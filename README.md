Always indecisive and trying to figure out where to eat when you're hanging out? Well look no further, this simple web application seeks to solve that issue. By leveraging Mapbox GL and some random restaurant/food db I can hopefully find for cheap in the future, you can roulette a place to eat in no time!

This is a project to try to improve my self confidence in programming, destroy my imposter syndrome, and hopefully land me a SWE job. üëç
